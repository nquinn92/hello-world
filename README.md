Ya know... because tutorials

I highly doubt anyone will ever read this... but here's a brief bio:

I graduated from my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 2015, and am close to finishing my master's degree in mechanical engineering with a focus on biomedical engineering applications fo robotics and control (expected graduation 2017). Recently I've rediscovered my love of programming and have been self-learning Python and C++ mainly with the intention of exploring machine learning techniques.
